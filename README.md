# Easy Einstein Summation

This is a Mathematica package for doing tensor operations using Einstein summation rules, which is especially useful if you are working with special relativity or elasticity.

This package:

1. **Does basic tensor operations including:**
   - Tensor product
   - Tensor contract
   - Symmetrize and anti-symmetrize
   - Derivative & parallel transport derivative in curved space.
2. **Has complete support for Einstein summation rules.**
3. **Supports calculation curved space of arbitrary dimension.**

...and it has the following exceptional features:

1. **WRITE AND COMPUTE!!!** You can painlessly input the expression using virtually anything:
   - Mathematica built-in non-linear type system or Math Assistant.
   - Windows' built-in Math Input Panel. (which allows you to **HANDWRITE** the expression!!!)
   - Word Equation or other sources which use MathML (e.g. MathType).
   - $\TeX$ strings.
2. **Use Operators everywhere!** You can use $\partial$ and $\nabla$ as operators! You may also get a result in the form of a operator!
3. **Free Symmetrize!** Support a very free usage of symmetrize symbol () and anti-symmetrize symbol []. e.g. you can write $\nabla^{[\mu} A^{\nu]}$, or even $A_{(\mu} \nabla_\nu B_{\sigma)}^{\ \ \nu}$, which do summation on $\nu$ first then symmetrize $\mu, \sigma$.
4. **Support symbolic tensors!!!** You can work on subjects even if you don't know the exact value or even the exact dimension, thanks to Mathematica's latest feature!!!



You may download the Mathematica paclet here for convenient installation, or you might also download and copy the files yourself.
