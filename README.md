# Easy Einstein Summation

This is a Mathematica package for doing tensor operations using Einstein summation rules, which is especially useful if you are working with special relativity or elasticity.

This package:

1. **Does basic tensor operations including:**
   - Tensor product
   - Tensor contract
   - Symmetrize and anti-symmetrize
   - Derivative & parallel transport derivative in curved space.
2. **Has complete support for Einstein summation rules.**
3. **Supports calculation curved space of arbitrary dimension.**

...and it has the following exceptional features:

1. **WRITE AND COMPUTE!!!** You can painlessly input the expression using virtually anything:
   - Mathematica built-in non-linear type system or Math Assistant.
   - Windows' built-in Math Input Panel. (which allows you to **HANDWRITE** the expression!!!)
   - Word Equation or other sources which use MathML (e.g. MathType).
   - ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?TeX) strings.
2. **Use Operators everywhere!** You can use ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?%5Cpartial) and ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?%5Cnabla) as operators! You may also get a result in the form of a operator!
3. **Free Symmetrize!** Support a very free usage of symmetrize symbol () and anti-symmetrize symbol []. e.g. you can write ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?%5Cnabla%5E%7B%5B%5Cmu%7D%20A%5E%7B%5Cnu%5D%7D), or even ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?A_%7B%28%5Cmu%7D%20%5Cnabla_%5Cnu%20B_%7B%5Csigma%29%7D%5E%7B%5C%20%5C%20%5Cnu%7D), which do summation on ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?%5Cnu) first then symmetrize ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?%5Cmu%2C%20%5Csigma).
4. **Support symbolic tensors!!!** You can work on subjects even if you don't know the exact value or even the exact dimension, thanks to Mathematica's latest feature!!!
